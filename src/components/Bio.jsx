          Hi, I'm Sven Elfgren, a product-driven engineering leader passionate about crafting
          intuitive, user-focused software experiences. With over a decade in the tech industry,
          I've led teams at companies like Lattice, where I helped scale our engineering
          organization and deliver impactful products.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-100">
          My career has taken me on a journey from hands-on software engineering to strategic
          leadership, and I've discovered that my greatest strength is building and nurturing
          high-performing, empathetic teams. I thrive on creating collaborative environments where
          innovation meets user needs, empowering teams to achieve their best work.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-100">
          When I'm not leading teams or writing code, you'll find me diving into the intricacies of
          modern web technologies or exploring the intersection of design, technology, and human
          psychology. I'm always eager for the next challenge, especially if it pushes the
          boundaries of what's conventional or expected.
